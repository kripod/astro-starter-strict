This is an [Astro](https://astro.build/) project bootstrapped from [astro-starter-strict](https://github.com/kripod/astro-starter-strict), built upon:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for refactoring with confidence
- [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), enforced through [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for consistency and clean diffs

Auto-fixes are performed on save with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or by using `pnpm run fix`.
