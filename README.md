## 💡 Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this multi-page website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show `"Can't be empty"`
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show `"Please use a valid email address"`
- View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)

## 🎯 My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Astro.js](https://astro.build/) – All-in-one web framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) – JS library
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - For form state management
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) – For styles
- [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) – Components on top of Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

- **Astro.js:**
    - I discovered Astro.js, a powerful static site generator that allows me to build fast and modern websites using
      components from different frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte.


- **Tailwind CSS:**
    - I deepened my knowledge of Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. It simplifies rapid development by offering
      pre-defined utility classes that can be combined to create complex designs while maintaining a clean and readable
      codebase.


- **Flowbite:**
    - I explored Flowbite, a comprehensive UI kit built with Tailwind CSS. It provided me with pre-designed components,
      layouts, and styles, helping me deepen my knowledge and skills with Tailwind CSS.


- **React Hook Forms and Components in Astro:**
    - I learned about React Hook Forms, a library for building forms in React, and integrated them into Astro sites. This
      allowed me to streamline form validation, state management, and user input handling while leveraging React's
      component-based architecture within Astro.js.
